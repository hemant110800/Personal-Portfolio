# Personal-Portfolio
Created a personal portfolio using React to effectively present my skills and projects. This portfolio serves as a comprehensive representation of my capabilities, allowing visitors to gain insight into my expertise and past work.

In designing the portfolio, I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. Through strategic layout and design choices, I aimed to ensure easy navigation and intuitive access to information. The portfolio is structured to highlight my skills,  and projects prominently, making it simple for visitors to explore and understand my background and capabilities.

Within the portfolio, I dedicated sections to showcase my various skills and expertise areas. Each skill is accompanied by a brief description outlining my proficiency level and relevant experience.
